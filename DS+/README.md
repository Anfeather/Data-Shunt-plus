This project implements the paper “Improving Large Models with Small models: Lower Costs and Better Performance ”(DS+),aiming to enhance the overall performance through the collaboration between pre-trained large models and specialized small models.DS+ not only substantially reduces the cost associated with querying large models but also effectively improves large models’ performance. For instance, ChatGPT achieves an accuracy of 94.43% on Amazon Product sentiment analysis, and DS+ achieves an accuracy of 95.64%, while the cost has been reduced to 31.18%.
